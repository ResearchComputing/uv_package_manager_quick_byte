# uv Package Manager

Python dependency management getting you burned? Tired of waiting on pip installs or struggling with clunky virtual environments on HPC systems? Say hello to UV, the lightning-fast Python package manager built for speed, simplicity, and sanity.

In this RC Quick Byte*, we’ll introduce you to UV and demonstrate how it works on CURC’s HPC system. We'll cover UV’s core features, including uv pip, uv venv and uv tool. We’ll also touch on how UV compares to traditional tools like pip and conda. By the end of this session, you'll have a clear understanding of how to get started using UV to manage Python packages efficiently on an HPC system.
